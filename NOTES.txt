0. Install necessary software:

   pip install keras
   pip install tensorflow=1.5 (our CPU doesn't support AVX instructions)

Or on newer CPUs:

   install CUDA.9.0 -- this messed up everything, and I had to
                       reinstall the kernel module.
   pip install keras tensorflow-gpu
   
1. Use imagemagick to rescale all images. Images smaller than 299x299
are centered on a white background, larger images are scaled down to
fit.  This preserves size for small images.

  (script: convert-images-sh)

2. Select classes to learn (more than xxx objects)

Split into random subsets, 100 validate, 100 test, rest in train

  (script: prepare-data.sh)
  parallel echo {} \| bash prepare-data.sh ::: $(ls data)

3. Run training

  (train.py)

4. Test performance

a) confusion matrix
b) error examples
